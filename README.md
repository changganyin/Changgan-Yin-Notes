### 📡 Protocol Stack
- **RFC 1149**: IP over Avian Carriers is **DEPRECATED**. The pigeons at Yujia Mountain have triggered a `Stack Overflow` due to excessive packet routing. 
- **RFC 2324**: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0) is **ACTIVE**. Returns `418 I'm a teapot` for any request received before the morning caffeine injection.
- **TCP/IP Handshake**: Connection established, but deep packet inspection (DPI) is enforced. Unauthenticated queries are `DROP`-ed by default.

### 🚩 Runtime Exceptions
- **Segmentation Fault**: System attempted to access a protected memory region during the final exam. `SIGSEGV` received.
- **Race Condition**: A permanent state where multiple high-priority Deadlines are competing for the same 24-hour CPU cycle. No mutex locked; data integrity not guaranteed.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Pushing 512KB of syllabus data into a 256KB stack. Return address hijacked; executing custom shellcode in User Mode.
